GWOSC Internal Portal
=====================

The GWOSC integration for CBCFlow is currently in an beta form, and is under review. 
It may be accessed through the GWOSC catalog portal, when logged in with LVK credentials (https://gwosc-rl8.ligo.caltech.edu/eventapi/html/).
The current testing instance is ``cbcflow.o4a``, and reflects the current state of the O4a library.
